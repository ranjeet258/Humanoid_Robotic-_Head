Title:-Humanoid Robotic Head
Description:-The robotic head is designed with a resin 3D-printed face for realistic aesthetics and smooth finish. It integrates cameras, microphones, and speakers for interaction, while servo/stepper actuators drive eyes, eyebrows, jaw, and neck for expressive movements. Processing is split between a Raspberry Pi for high-level functions and a microcontroller for precise, real-time motor control.
Key Points
Resin 3D-printed faceplate → smooth, realistic surface, paint-ready finish
Cameras (stereo vision) → depth perception & tracking
MEMS microphones + speakers → far-field audio capture & voice output
Servo→ animate eyes, eyebrows, jaw, and neck rotation
Raspberry Pi → handles AI, voice assistant, high-level tasks
Microcontroller → manages motors & sensor feedback in real-time
Mechanical design → clean cable routing, easy upgrades
