  - Smooth, realistic surface with a paint-ready finish for human-like aesthetics.  
- **Vision System (Stereo Cameras)**  
  - Provides depth perception for object and face tracking.  
- **Audio System**  
  - **MEMS Microphones** for far-field voice capture.  
  - **Speakers** for natural voice output.  
- **Actuation**  
  - **Servo Motors** drive eyes, eyebrows, jaw, and neck rotation for realistic expressions.  
- **Processing Units**  
  - **Raspberry Pi**: High-level AI, voice assistant, and vision tasks.  
  - **Microcontroller**: Real-time motor control and sensor feedback.  
- **Mechanical Design**  
  - Clean cable routing, modular components, and easy upgrade options.
